          <p>
            Hello! My name is Milan Dewilde and I&rsquo;m a student of Applied
            Computer Science at University College Ghent.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like climbing, hiking, surfing and travelling in general. I am a
            very social and optimistic person with a passion for technology. I
            like working in teams, taking responsibility for my work and making
            sure that I always do my part. I also enjoy trying to understand
            complex systems and I always try to keep up with innovations. To me,
            contributing to the innovation and replacement of obsolete
            technology is a process I'd love to be a part of and I hope to be
            able to make a job out of this passion one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently I discovered that computer networks and systems management
            is the field that interests me most, and so I've decided to look
            into some online courses on cloud storage and services to keep
            myself in the loop on the latest technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve created this website to serve as a professional diary in
            which I keep track of my achievements and things I&rsquo;ve learned
            along the way.

                <h4>Studying applied computer science</h4>
                <p>
                  For now I am still in school, studying Applied Computer
                  Sciences. HoGent is where I truly discovered the possibilities
                  and depth that the world of IT has to offer. Even though I've
                  learned so much over the course of my studies, I am sure that
                  I'll be discovering interesting and exciting things for the
                  rest of my life. This, to me, is one of the most wonderful
                  things about working in IT.

                <p>
                  Whenever I'm not at home or at school I try to work at
                  Vayamundo. Even though waiting tables certainly isn't what I
                  see myself doing for the rest of my life, I find it very
                  enjoyable as a student job. Recently I started looking for a
                  more relevant job in networking, and have been contacted by a
                  small Ostend based company to create network topologies and to
                  configure network devices.

                <h3>Ghent University</h3>
                <h4>Studying political science</h4>
                <p>
                  My career as a student started at Ghent University, studying
                  political science. I chose this as my first subject because of
                  my interest in society and the structures behind governments
                  and international organisations. Even though politics and
                  societal research still interest me, it quickly became clear
                  that a career in political science would not satisfy my thirst
                  for innovation and technology. This drove me to end these
                  studies in my second year, after which I enrolled at Hogent.

                <p>
                  In our last years of secundary school, some friends and I
                  decided to start hosting parties and musical events in
                  Ostend's largest venue, Hangar 1. We hosted multiple events
                  over the span of 3 years for over 1000 visitors at a time,
                  working with teams of about 40 volunteers each time. We
                  donated the larger part of the proceeds to various local
                  charities like Organising and managing these events really
                  helped develop my social and organisational skills a lot.

                <h4>Head Leader</h4>
                <p>
                  Ever since I was six years old I started going to Chiro
                  Mariakerke, an organisation for entertaining children and
                  teenagers over the weekend. Being a part of the Chiro made me
                  a more sociable and responsable person. It is for that very
                  reason that I felt such a connection to this organisation,
                  that I eventually became the Head Leader. My time as the Head
                  Leader taught me a lot about organising and managing people in
                  teams, solving problems in creative ways, working together
                  with different people and different cultures but most of all,
                  it taught me a lot about being responsable.

                <h4>Studying Latin - Languages</h4>
                <p>
                  I started secondary school in Ostend, studying Latin - Modern
                  Languages. I had a great time here and learned a lot. Language
                  is something that I still enjoy learning to this day. This
                  course also ensured that I am fluent in English, that my
                  french is good, and that I have a good basic understanding of
                  Spanish and German.

                My first real programming project was Pazaak, a card game featured in the Star Wars universe. The objective was
                to create the game, as well as to create a database and to configure integration for logging in users, registering new users and saving games and high scores.
                This project was also the first time I worked in a team to complete a large task, which was a very good learning experience,
                and also the first time we used the Scrum-principles.
              </p>
              <p>
                The application itself was programmed in Java. Database software was MySQL and to create the GUI, we used JavaFX.

              <p>
                The goal for this project was to create queries to extract data from a database. After we had extracted
                this data, we had to select relevant data to create a datawarehouse. Lastly, using the queries we had created and
                applying them to our newly created datawarehouse, we had to create graphs using Microsoft's PowerBI.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project gave me a much better understanding of SQL, as well as further enhancing my skills for working in teams.
                Creating graphs from data we had extracted in very specific ways was a very interesting exercise with a lot of 
                potential for real-world application.

                An introduction into the world of Cybersecurity, provided by Cisco. I took this course because
                network security is an interesting topic to me, and I felt that no other course in school properly
                prepared us for possible dangers to network infrastructure. The course taught me the very basics of Cybersecurity,
                as well as clarifying the most important and dangerous forms of cyberattacks
              </p>
              <p>
                in this course we used Cisco's Packet Tracer to examine some network attacks and vulnerabilities, and Wireshark to exemplify the vulnerabilites of certain transfer protocols.

                A project I've been working on in my free time. The game is a simple 2D platformer that provides all the basic functions like jumping, running, attacking and ducking. I started working on this game to see the possibilities Unity provides,
                as well as taking a first look at C#, the language in which I wrote the scripts controlling movement and object behaviour.

              <p>
                Creating this webserver was by far my favourite project so far. The objective was to automate the deployment of a Virtual Machine that was running a LAMP-stack. For this project I had to learn scripting, as well as Linux and PHP. It was the most difficult project I've had so far, but definately the most rewarding upon completion.
                I wrote scripts that automated the installation of all required software, as well as creating a database and scripts for backing up said database to a different virtual server. After deployment was complete, I wrote a very simple web-application for loging in members
                that were registered within the database and displaying content based on their permissions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The installation script were mostly shell scripts and were run by Vagrant. The web-application was written in PHP, HTML and CSS.

                A Cisco course teaching initial network device configuration and setting up routes, as well as more complex routing protocols and inter-VLAN networking. This course was very interesting to me because I enjoy understanding how things are connected.

                Most configurations were done in Packet Tracer, but I also did some on physical Cisco devices.

                The first website I ever wrote was very similar to this one, only a lot worse. It did teach me a lot about HTML and CSS however, and later on also about JavaScript. I enjoy doing some webdesign on the side.

                My first website was written in HTML and CSS and had some very basic JavaScript scripts.
